Data science is used to study data in four main ways:

1. Descriptive analysis
Descriptive analysis examines data to gain insights into what happened or what is happening in the data environment. It is characterized by data visualizations such as pie charts, bar charts, line graphs, tables, or generated narratives. For example, a flight booking service may record data like the number of tickets booked each day. Descriptive analysis will reveal booking spikes, booking slumps, and high-performing months for this service.

2. Diagnostic analysis
Diagnostic analysis is a deep-dive or detailed data examination to understand why something happened. It is characterized by techniques such as drill-down, data discovery, data mining, and correlations. Multiple data operations and transformations may be performed on a given data set to discover unique patterns in each of these techniques.For example, the flight service might drill down on a particularly high-performing month to better understand the booking spike. This may lead to the discovery that many customers visit a particular city to attend a monthly sporting event.

3. Predictive analysis
Predictive analysis uses historical data to make accurate forecasts about data patterns that may occur in the future. It is characterized by techniques such as machine learning, forecasting, pattern matching, and predictive modeling. In each of these techniques, computers are trained to reverse engineer causality connections in the data.For example, the flight service team might use data science to predict flight booking patterns for the coming year at the start of each year. The computer program or algorithm may look at past data and predict booking spikes for certain destinations in May. Having anticipated their customerâ€™s future travel requirements, the company could start targeted advertising for those cities from February.

4. Prescriptive analysis
Prescriptive analytics takes predictive data to the next level. It not only predicts what is likely to happen but also suggests an optimum response to that outcome. It can analyze the potential implications of different choices and recommend the best course of action. It uses graph analysis, simulation, complex event processing, neural networks, and recommendation engines from machine learning.         

Back to the flight booking example, prescriptive analysis could look at historical marketing campaigns to maximize the advantage of the upcoming booking spike. A data scientist could project booking outcomes for different levels of marketing spend on various marketing channels. These data forecasts would give the flight booking company greater confidence in their marketing decisions.
